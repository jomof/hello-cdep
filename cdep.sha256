# This file contains a list of CDep coordinates along with the SHA256 hash of their
# manifest file. This is to ensure that a manifest hasn't changed since the last
# time CDep ran.
# The recommended best practice is to check this file into source control so that
# anyone else who builds this project is guaranteed to get the same dependencies.
